# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Kanhaiya Gupta

I'm a Python developer and data scientist with a background in experimental physics. I specialize in building scalable ETL pipelines, deploying machine learning models, and developing AI solutions. My experience spans esteemed institutions like BAM and CERN, where I've applied technologies such as AWS, Kubernetes, FastAPI, and MLOps practices.
